Hello Mini-Monkey,

Can you please take a look at this JS code about my JWT implementation on /administrator endpoint :

const adminToken = "mY_p3rS0n4l_t0k3N_f0r_mY_0Wn_JwT"
const adminTokenEncoded = Buffer.from(adminToken).toString('bese64');

Can't wait to test your new implementation of secure notes in our infrastructure !!


Bye,
