#  Web Challenges - CLOG

At the start of 2023, I set myself the goal of instilling a passion for Web pentesting in my fellow (mostly novice) students.

This "project" has also enabled me to get to grips with web development, and to understand vulnerabilities perfectly well enough to embed them in source code.

## Authors

I didn't do this project alone, in fact I needed someone very good at deployment to get the challenge instances online and secure them correctly.

I also suggested to my colleagues to add challenges/technologies they found interesting.

## Documentation

All challenges are developed in NodeJS for the backend. 
Most of the files directly include the DockerFile and the .json package for rapid project launch.

A simple `node xx.js` allows you to launch it on localhost.
