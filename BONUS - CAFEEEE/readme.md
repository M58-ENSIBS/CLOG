# CAFEEEEE (With 4Es)

## Overview

Welcome to the CafÃ©ine Calculator, a fun project born out of a coffee aficionado's quest to keep caffeine intake in check. This web application allows users to calculate and monitor (not yet) their caffeine consumption from various sources, ranging from coffee drinks to energy drinks and snacks.

The website is available at [https://m58.fr/COFEEEE](https://m58.fr/CAFEEEE)

## Why this project?

Me and my friends are coffee lovers. We enjoy a good cup of coffee, but we also want to keep our caffeine intake in check. We often find ourselves wondering how much caffeine we've consumed in a day, and how much more we can have before we reach our daily limit. This tool is meant to help us answer those questions.

## Features

    Step-by-Step Selection:
        The user begins by choosing a category of drinks/snacks from a list.
        Next, they select a specific item from the chosen category.
        Finally, they input the size of the drink to receive an estimated caffeine dose.

    Categories:
        Bottled Coffee Drinks
        Caffeinated Water and Others Beverages
        Energy Drinks
        Over-the-Counter Drugs or Supplements
        Coffee and Tea Drinks from Coffee Shops
        Caffeinated Snacks
        Chocolate, Ice Cream, or Yogurt
        Coffee and Espresso (Ground)
        Soft Drinks
        Tea (Bottles; Tea Bags)

    Total Caffeine Calculation:
        The tool calculates and displays the total estimated caffeine dose based on the user's selections.

## Limits of the project

As I'm really bad in CSS and Native JS, the project is not really beautiful and the code is not really clean. I'm sorry for that, I'm working on it.


## Customize and Contribute

Feel free to customize and expand upon this project. It's open for contributions and enhancements. Whether you want to add new categories, fun facts, or additional features, your creativity is the limit!
